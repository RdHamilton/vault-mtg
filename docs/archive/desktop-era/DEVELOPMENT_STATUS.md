### Context for Claude:
- **Current Version**: v1.2.0 (ready for release)
- **Next Version**: v1.3 (Deck Builder with AI recommendations)
- We use a REST API server (Go) + React SPA frontend (browser-based)
- **Service-based architecture**: Daemon (background) + API Server + React Frontend
- **Daemon mode (recommended)**: 24/7 log monitoring, WebSocket events
- **Standalone mode (fallback)**: API server with embedded poller
- Follow responsive design principles (see docs/CLAUDE_CODE_GUIDE.md)
- Material Design-inspired dark theme
- All UI must work 800x600 to 1920x1080+
- Real-time updates via WebSocket events

### Architecture (v1.2):
- **Daemon** (`cmd/vaultmtg/daemon.go`): Background service, WebSocket server
- **API Server** (`cmd/apiserver/main.go`): REST API server, delegates to facades
- **Facades** (`internal/gui/*_facade.go`): Domain-specific facades (Match, Draft, Deck, Card, Export, System)
- **Patterns** (`internal/events/`, `internal/commands/`): Observer & Command patterns
- **Strategies** (`internal/mtga/draft/insights/*_strategy.go`): Format-specific analysis
- **Shared** (`internal/mtga/logprocessor/`): Log parsing logic
- **IPC** (`internal/ipc/`): WebSocket client/server
- **Storage** (`internal/storage/`): SQLite database, repositories

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete architecture documentation.
