# Contributing to VaultMTG

Thank you for your interest in contributing to VaultMTG! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go 1.23+** - The project requires Go 1.23.12 or later
- **Git** - For version control
- **MTG Arena** - For testing (optional, but helpful)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vault-mtg.git
   cd vault-mtg
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/RdHamilton/vault-mtg.git
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

5. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev.sh check
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run all checks
   ./scripts/dev.sh check
   
   # Run tests
   ./scripts/test.sh
   
   # Run tests with coverage
   ./scripts/test.sh coverage
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: brief description of your change"
   ```

   Use clear, descriptive commit messages. Prefix with:
   - `Add:` for new features
   - `Fix:` for bug fixes
   - `Update:` for updates to existing features
   - `Refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `Docs:` for documentation changes

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub

### Code Standards

#### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use `gofumpt` for stricter formatting (if available)
- Run `go vet` to catch common mistakes
- Follow Go best practices and idioms

The project includes scripts to help with this:

```bash
# Format code
./scripts/dev.sh fmt

# Run all checks
./scripts/dev.sh check
```

#### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Write clear, descriptive names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Write tests for new functionality

#### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Run tests with race detection:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/test.sh race
  ```
