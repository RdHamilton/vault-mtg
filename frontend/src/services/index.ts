/**
 * Services Index
 *
 * This module provides a centralized export point for all service modules,
 * including the API client, WebSocket client, and API service modules.
 *
 * These services are designed to replace Wails bindings, enabling:
 * - REST API communication instead of direct Go function calls
 * - SSE-based real-time events (fetch + Authorization header) instead of Wails EventsOn/EventsOff
 * - Better testability with standard HTTP mocking
 * - Potential for running as a standalone web app (without Wails)
